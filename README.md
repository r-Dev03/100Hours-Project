## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MongoDB, Javascript, EJS, CSS, HTML5, Express, NodeJS, REST

Built from the ground up using the mentioned technologies, user's have the ability to login to save their products in their own curated cart. 
Each page is set in a retro-style layout and products are aligned in a simple format to allow the user to feel comfortable when browsing. Adding and deleting products from your cart is simple and easy.
Take a look and let me know what you think!


## Growth:

Building this project took a lot of time and effort. This also means making a lot of mistakes, however as an engineer mistakes are looked upon as an opportunity to learn, so what better way to learn than to break something, right? 
Naturally, upon building this project I found there were a lot of things foreign to me, especially when dealing with a templating language like EJS. 
There are a lot of limitations that come with it or building out a cart system from scratch, however, that also gave me a lot of time to explore and delve deeper into the technologies I was using to make everything work together seamlessly and really polish my skills.

## Future Optimizations: 

I would like to add 
- Admin panel for inventory management
- Different color options for each product
- Different product category
